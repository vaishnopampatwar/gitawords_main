                    Karma, <b>yathâ kaumâram </b>– like the stage of childhood,<b> yauvanam </b>-
                    youth,<b>jarâ </b>- old age. These three stages come naturally, in the same way,

                    not deluded due to his strength of Self knowledge. A courageous man
                    does not grieve thinking that ‘I will die’ because he knows that there is no
                    death for the Âtmâ (Self). It is to be understood that an illustration of one

                    is neither born,<b>na mriyate</b>e - nor dies. The two words - ‘Vâ’ in the first
                    line and in the second line should be taken in the sense of ‘Cha’ which
                    means ‘and’, that is - even when the body is being killed, the individual
                    Self neither decays nor perishes. In this case all creatures attain birth and
                    death. These two events never affect the Kshetragnya, the Self.
                    <b>Nâyam bhutvâ bhavitâ vâ na bhuyah</b>- It should not be understood that this Self,
                    having been born at the beginning of the cosmic creation (i.e. bhutvâ),
                    <b>bhuyah</b>- and again at the end of the dissolution, <b>na
                        bhavitâ </b>- will not be there. But at the time of the beginning and end of a
                    Kalpa, the mega epoch, the birth and death being experienced by
                    Hiranyagarbha and others, do not afflict or defeat the Self, a vital point to be considered.
                    <b>Tatah-ajah </b>- Hence, the Self is<b> aja</b>– unborn, that is without
                    birth.<b>Ata eva nityodhruvah</b>- Therefore it is eternal, firm and uniform at

                    ever new even though ancient; which is realized by visionaries of the Self
                    as fresh at all times. Therefore even when the body is being killed, the Self
                    is not killed.</p>

                    existence at the beginning of creation and it ceases to be at the time of
                    dissolution. Hence the Self, which resides in all bodies, is eternal, uniform
                    at all times, immutable and ancient (as well as) capable of being experienced by the seers, as fresh at all times. Therefore it is not slain when the
